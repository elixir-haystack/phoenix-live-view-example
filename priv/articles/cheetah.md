%{name: "Cheetah"}

---

The cheetah is a large, slender cat found in Africa and known for its incredible speed, capable of reaching up to 112 km/h. They are primarily diurnal hunters, feeding on small to medium-sized prey such as gazelles and impalas. Cheetahs are social animals, often living in small groups or pairs. They are threatened by habitat loss, human conflict, and declines in prey populations.
