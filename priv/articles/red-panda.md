%{name: "Red Panda"}

---

The red panda is a small, arboreal mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It is roughly the size of a domestic cat, with reddish-brown fur, a bushy tail, and white markings on its face and ears. Red pandas are primarily nocturnal and feed on bamboo, as well as fruits, insects, and small animals. They are solitary animals and are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their fur.
